First of all. Open terminal and navigate to the "Weather-in-your-location folder", and do copy paste this line git clone: https://github.com/darkskyapp/skycons.git
This will get the skycons (animated weather images) for app to use.

Next go to app.js file into the line 19 and 20, and put your own API keys to the spot in URL where is text "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
Those lines include introductions (comments) how to do this.
